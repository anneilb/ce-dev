Hi Ilia,
Here is my submission for assignment 6.

For exercise 1, I've implemented separate TCP and UDP clients. I interpreted your assignment instructions to mean we needed to implement both. I only realized in last week's class that it should have been only one with the protocol of our choice. In any case, both are done.

For exercise 2, I implemented a multi-tier application design. As you suggested, I implemented a DBManager class to manage the low level DB connection handling and generic SQL calls. This means that it could be used to handle a completely different type of database if needed like SQL Server, etc. 

There is then a class named ProductDB that uses the DBManager to connect to the related MySQL DB and provides public methods for manipulating data in the Product table. 

Finally, there is a Product class which represent the business layer. It represents a single product record. It is used the by the user interface (ProductDBManager) to send and receive data stored in the Product table.

If you need change the database connection details, you can edit the following constants in the ProductDB class:

CONNECTION_URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Anneil
